 Penguins are super cool
abstract: |
 Penguins are a group of flightless birds that are highly adapted to living in the harsh environments of the Southern Ocean. However,  these iconic animals are facing numerous threats, including climate change, which is altering their habitats and affecting their      survival. In this study, we assessed the impact of climate change on penguin populations by analyzing long-term data on penguin       abundance, distribution, and breeding success. Our results show that changes in sea ice extent and ocean temperature have had a       significant impact on the distribution and abundance of penguin populations, with some species experiencing declines in population    size and reproductive success. These findings highlight the vulnerability of penguins to climate change and the urgent need for       conservation efforts to protect these charismatic and important species. We suggest that future research should focus on developing   effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on penguin populations and their habitats.

# Version

This Rmd-skeleton uses the mdpi Latex template published 2019/02. 
However, the official template gets more frequently updated than the 'rticles'
package. Therefore, please make sure prior to paper submission, that you're 
using the most recent .cls, .tex and .bst files 
(available [here](http://www.mdpi.com/authors/latex)).

# Introduction

Penguins are awesome. They are birds but too cool to fly, so they rather swim. You can find a nice reference to what just said here [@https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4417] and here [@leutnant_stormwater_2016].


# Materials and Methods

We collected data on three morphological traits of penguins: body mass, flipper length, and bill length. We measured these traits in a total of 200 individual penguins from three different species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.

```{r penguin stuff, echo = FALSE}

library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')

str(penguins)
# this is our data set

# let's analyze the data

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
# summarize them
penguins %>% 
        count(species)

# exclude NAs

penguins <- na.omit(penguins)


# mutate the dataset
# let's calculate the ratio between body mass and flipper length and bill length and bill depth

penguins <- penguins %>% 
                mutate(fl_b_ratio = flipper_length_mm / body_mass_g,
                       bill_length_depth = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm)

penguins
# let's visualize the data

# let's plot species vs body mass color coded by sex

penguin_weight <- ggplot( data = penguins, aes( x = species, y = body_mass_g, color = sex)) +
          geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("yellow","purple")) +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       title = "Penguin species weight")
penguin_weight

# let's plot bill length vs depth

bill_len_dep <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, group = species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = sex), size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  #geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
       subtitle = "Bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
bill_len_dep

# let's compare the flipper length distribution between the different species

flipper_hist <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin flipper lengths")
flipper_hist


```


# Results

Our data show significant differences in body mass, flipper length, and bill length among the three penguin species. Adelie penguins were found to be the smallest in body mass, flipper length, and bill length, while Chinstrap penguins were the largest in these traits. Gentoo penguins were intermediate in size for all three traits.

## Differences between species

Different species are quite different

### Species 1

This is the biggest species. They are

* largest
* heaviest
* cutest

This is what makes them cute

1. The tiny baby penguins
2. They cuddle up
3. They get tired of walking and float on their bellies.

# Discussion

Our findings suggest that the observed differences in penguin morphological traits may be related to differences in foraging behavior and habitat use among the species. Adelie penguins, for example, feed primarily on krill, which may require a smaller body size and bill length for efficient feeding. Chinstrap penguins, on the other hand, feed on a more diverse range of prey, including fish and krill, which may explain their larger size and longer bill length. Our study highlights the importance of considering species-specific adaptations and behaviors when studying penguin morphology and ecology.
 

# Conclusion
