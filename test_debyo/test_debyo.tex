% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{Penguins are a group of flightless birds that are highly
adapted to living in the harsh environments of the Southern Ocean.
However, these iconic animals are facing numerous threats, including
climate change, which is altering their habitats and affecting their
survival. In this study, we assessed the impact of climate change on
penguin populations by analyzing long-term data on penguin abundance,
distribution, and breeding success. Our results show that changes in sea
ice extent and ocean temperature have had a significant impact on the
distribution and abundance of penguin populations, with some species
experiencing declines in population size and reproductive success. These
findings highlight the vulnerability of penguins to climate change and
the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these charismatic
and important species. We suggest that future research should focus on
developing effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of
climate change on penguin populations and their habitats.}

Penguins are awesome. They are birds but too cool to fly, so they rather
swim. You can find a nice reference to what just said here

We collected data on three morphological traits of penguins: body mass,
flipper length, and bill length. We measured these traits in a total of
200 individual penguins from three different species: Adelie, Gentoo,
and Chinstrap.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

Our data show significant differences in body mass, flipper length, and
bill length among the three penguin species. Adelie penguins were found
to be the smallest in body mass, flipper length, and bill length, while
Chinstrap penguins were the largest in these traits. Gentoo penguins
were intermediate in size for all three traits.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Our findings suggest that the observed differences in penguin
morphological traits may be related to differences in foraging behavior
and habitat use among the species. Adelie penguins, for example, feed
primarily on krill, which may require a smaller body size and bill
length for efficient feeding. Chinstrap penguins, on the other hand,
feed on a more diverse range of prey, including fish and krill, which
may explain their larger size and longer bill length. Our study
highlights the importance of considering species-specific adaptations
and behaviors when studying penguin morphology and ecology.
